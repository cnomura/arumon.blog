Most data teams talk about “visibility”, but can’t actually explain what ran, when, and why it failed.

In this post I walk through how I approached pipeline observability:
- snapshot vs incremental mode
- Teams alerting
- storing runtime state on disk / lake
- emitting OpenLineage events so downstream consumers know *where the data came from*.

This is based on real production work in an airline context.
